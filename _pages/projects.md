<h2><b> COVID INFECTION INDEX: A GEOGRAPHICALLY WEIGHTED APPROACH IN ASSESSING COVID INFECTION IN NYC [<a href="http://AlDeleon012597.github.io/files/CovidInfectionIndex_SubmissionFinal.pdf">PDF</a>] [<a href="https://github.com/AlDeleon012597/Covid-Infection-Index">GITHUB</a>]</b></h2>

<p>The aim of this study is to identify which variables exhibit the strongest correlation with the infection rate of COVID-19, specifically in relation to occupation and transportation, household and living conditions, socioeconomic status, everyday activities, and health and age. Additionally, the Covid Infection Index (CII) is developed based on the identified variables, which serves as a tool to assess the susceptibility of communities to COVID-19 infection, while accounting for the diverse geographical landscape of New York City (NYC).  Multiple linear regression (MLR) and geographical weighted regression (GWR) were used to measure the relationship between the variables considered and the infection rate of COVID-19.  The GWR analysis was run using Zip Code Tabulation Areas. Geographically weighted principal component analysis (GWPCA) and principal component analysis (PCA) are then used to create the CII using Census Tract geography and data. Given the granularity of Census Tracts and the use of geographic weighted techniques, this study provides a method of understanding how the impact of COVID-19 individually affects the diverse communities of NYC. </p>

<h2><b>IMPACT OF POOR STREET LIGHTING ON CRIME IN THE BRONX [<a href="http://AlDeleon012597.github.io/files/Crimeinthebronx.pdf">PDF</a>]</b></h2>

<h5> Final Project for GTECH709 (Intro to GIS) <span class="w3-opacity"> December 2018 </span></h5> </div>

<div class="w3-container">
<p>In this article, we investigate the relationship between poorly lit areas in The Bronx and crimes commonly thought to occur in the dark. Hot Spot Analysis, Inverse Distance Weighted interpolation, and slope are used to explore this relationship. Crimes such as larceny, burglary, robbery, and theft are considered. We define poorly lit areas as areas that experience a high volume of 311 complaints regarding poor street light conditions due to a missing or damaged streetlight. We hypothesize that poorly lit areas are more susceptible to the crimes listed. The results, however, demonstrated the opposite: areas of more reported crime experienced fewer 311 complaints.

<h2><b> PREDICTING STROKE IN PATIENTS [<a href="https://sites.google.com/view/strokepredictor/home">SITE</a>] [<a href="https://github.com/AlDeleon012597/Covid-Infection-Index](https://github.com/AlDeleon012597/Stroke_Prediction/tree/main">GITHUB</a>]</b></h2>

<h5> Final Project for MATH328 (Techniques in Data Science) <span class="w3-opacity"> May 2021 </span></h5> </div>

<div class="w3-container">
<p>In this analysis we will attempt to predict whether or not a patient will have a stroke based on a number of characteristics. Dataset was found on kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/fedesoriano/stroke-prediction-dataset. The data source is "confidential". This dataset contains information on patients who had (or did not have) a stroke. Patient information includes gender, body mass index, average glucose level, residence type, if the patient is a smoker, and so on.
