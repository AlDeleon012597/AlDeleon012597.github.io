<h2><b> COVID INFECTION INDEX: A GEOGRAPHICALLY WEIGHTED APPROACH IN ASSESSING COVID INFECTION IN NYC </b></h2>[PDF](http://AlDeleon012597.github.io/files/CovidInfectionIndex_SubmissionFinal.pdf)

<p>The aim of this study is to identify which variables exhibit the strongest correlation with the infection rate of COVID-19, specifically in relation to occupation and transportation, household and living conditions, socioeconomic status, everyday activities, and health and age. Additionally, the Covid Infection Index (CII) is developed based on the identified variables, which serves as a tool to assess the susceptibility of communities to COVID-19 infection, while accounting for the diverse geographical landscape of New York City (NYC).  Multiple linear regression (MLR) and geographical weighted regression (GWR) were used to measure the relationship between the variables considered and the infection rate of COVID-19.  The GWR analysis was run using Zip Code Tabulation Areas. Geographically weighted principal component analysis (GWPCA) and principal component analysis (PCA) are then used to create the CII using Census Tract geography and data. Given the granularity of Census Tracts and the use of geographic weighted techniques, this study provides a method of understanding how the impact of COVID-19 individually affects the diverse communities of NYC. </p>
